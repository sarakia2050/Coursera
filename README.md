# Applied Data Science Capstone in coursera
SpaceX of Elon Musk,
Elon Musk predict for space trip  with a cost of 62 million dollars;
other firma cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage.
Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.

In this project, I have explained step by step and at the end I have predicted the project with several models and drawn a comparison chart.
